# Progress Tracking Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Attempts Counter Not Incrementing**
**Problem**: The `attempts` field was always 0 even when problems were attempted.

**Fix**: Updated `updateProblemProgress` in `server/src/controllers/progressController.js`:
- Added logic to increment `attempts` when status changes to 'attempted' or 'completed'
- Set `attempts: 1` for new progress records
- Update `lastAttemptDate` on every status change

### 2. **Streak Calculation Not Working**
**Problem**: User streaks were not being calculated properly.

**Fix**: 
- Removed conflicting post-save hook from `Progress` model
- Created dedicated `updateUserStreak` function in progress controller
- Properly calculate day differences and update streak logic
- Update `lastActiveDate` on every progress update

### 3. **Progress Not Persisting After Logout/Login**
**Problem**: Progress data was not being properly fetched and displayed after user logout/login.

**Fix**:
- Updated `fetchUserProgress` to properly store comprehensive statistics
- Fixed progress slice to handle the complete data structure
- Added proper data refresh in `ProblemList` component after updates
- Enhanced topic detail page to fetch progress data on load

### 4. **UI Not Updating After Progress Changes**
**Problem**: UI was not reflecting progress changes immediately.

**Fix**:
- Added `fetchUserProgress()` call after each progress update in `ProblemList`
- Updated `updateProblemStatus` action in topics slice
- Enhanced progress calculation logic in topic detail page
- Added proper state management for progress updates

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes

1. **`server/src/controllers/progressController.js`**:
   - Fixed `updateProblemProgress` to properly increment attempts
   - Added `updateUserStatsAndStreak` helper function
   - Added `updateUserStreak` helper function
   - Enhanced progress tracking logic

2. **`server/src/models/Progress.js`**:
   - Removed conflicting post-save hook
   - Kept clean schema with proper indexes

### Frontend Changes

1. **`client/src/store/slices/progressSlice.ts`**:
   - Fixed `fetchUserProgress.fulfilled` to store complete statistics
   - Enhanced `updateProgress.fulfilled` to handle progress updates

2. **`client/src/components/features/ProblemList/index.tsx`**:
   - Added `fetchUserProgress()` call after progress updates
   - Enhanced status update logic

3. **`client/src/app/(dashboard)/topics/[slug]/page.tsx`**:
   - Added progress data fetching on component load
   - Enhanced progress calculation logic
   - Added attempted problems count display

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Start the server**: `npm start` (in server directory)
2. **Start the client**: `npm run dev` (in client directory)
3. **Login and navigate to a topic**
4. **Click on problem status icons to change status**
5. **Verify that**:
   - Attempts counter increments
   - Progress persists after logout/login
   - UI updates immediately after status changes
   - Streak calculation works properly

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ **Attempts Counter**: Should increment from 0 to 1, 2, etc. when problems are attempted/completed
- ✅ **Progress Persistence**: Progress should remain visible after logout/login
- ✅ **UI Updates**: Status icons should change immediately after clicking
- ✅ **Streak Calculation**: User streaks should update based on daily activity
- ✅ **Time Tracking**: Time spent should be captured and displayed
- ✅ **Progress Statistics**: All progress cards should show correct data

## API Response Structure

The progress update API now returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "_id": "progress_id",
    "userId": "user_id",
    "problemId": "problem_id",
    "topicId": "topic_id",
    "status": "attempted|completed|revisit",
    "language": "javascript",
    "timeSpent": 15,
    "attempts": 2,  // Now properly incremented
    "confidence": 3,
    "isBookmarked": false,
    "lastAttemptDate": "2025-08-24T08:06:28.925Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-24T08:06:28.930Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-08-24T08:10:37.999Z"
  }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Status changes are reflected instantly in the UI
2. **Persistent Progress**: Progress data survives logout/login cycles
3. **Accurate Statistics**: All progress metrics are calculated correctly
4. **Time Tracking**: Users can track time spent on each problem
5. **Streak Motivation**: Users can see their learning streaks

## Next Steps

1. Test all progress tracking features thoroughly
2. Verify streak calculation across different days
3. Test with multiple users and problems
4. Monitor performance with large datasets
5. Add progress analytics and insights
