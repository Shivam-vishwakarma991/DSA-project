# Progress Tracking Guide

## Current Status

Based on your API response, you have:
- **3 attempted problems** (Squares of a Sorted Array, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, Two Sum)
- **0 completed problems**
- **21 minutes total time spent**
- **0% completion rate**

## How to See Progress Data

### 1. **Progress Page** (`/progress`)
The progress page now shows:
- âœ… **Total Attempted**: 3 problems (new card added)
- âœ… **Total Solved**: 0 problems (will increase when you complete problems)
- âœ… **Time Spent**: 21 minutes
- âœ… **Recent Activity**: Shows your 3 attempted problems
- âœ… **Topic Progress**: Shows Arrays topic with 0/3 completed

### 2. **Topic Detail Page** (`/topics/arrays`)
- Shows progress circle with 0% completion
- Displays "3 Problems", "0 Completed", "3 Attempted"
- Problem list shows attempted problems with yellow clock icons

## How to Complete a Problem

### Method 1: Using the UI
1. Go to `/topics/arrays`
2. Click on the **yellow clock icon** next to any problem
3. Enter time spent (e.g., 30 minutes)
4. Click "Update"
5. The status will change to **completed** (green checkmark)

### Method 2: Using the API
```bash
# Mark a problem as completed
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5001/api/progress/problem/PROBLEM_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "completed",
    "timeSpent": 30,
    "language": "javascript",
    "confidence": 3
  }'
```

## Status Progression

The problem status follows this cycle:
```
pending â†’ attempted â†’ completed â†’ revisit â†’ pending
```

- **pending**: Not started (gray circle)
- **attempted**: In progress (yellow clock)
- **completed**: Finished (green checkmark)
- **revisit**: Marked for review (blue arrow)

## What You'll See After Completing a Problem

### Progress Page Updates:
- **Total Solved**: 1 (instead of 0)
- **Completion Rate**: 33% (1/3 problems)
- **User Stats**: Updated with solved count
- **Recent Activity**: Shows completed problem

### Topic Page Updates:
- **Progress Circle**: Shows 33% completion
- **Stats**: "1 Completed" instead of "0 Completed"
- **Problem Status**: Green checkmark instead of yellow clock

## Testing the Progress

### Run the completion test:
```bash
cd dsa-mastery-platform
node test-complete-problem.js
```

This will:
1. Find an attempted problem
2. Mark it as completed
3. Show you the updated progress

### Expected Results:
- **Before**: 0 completed, 3 attempted, 0% completion
- **After**: 1 completed, 2 attempted, 33% completion

## Data Flow

1. **User clicks status icon** â†’ Frontend sends API request
2. **Backend updates progress** â†’ Increments attempts, updates user stats
3. **Frontend refreshes data** â†’ Calls `fetchUserProgress()`
4. **UI updates** â†’ Shows new status and statistics

## Troubleshooting

### If you don't see updates:
1. **Refresh the page** - Data should persist
2. **Check browser console** - Look for API errors
3. **Verify API response** - Should show updated attempts count
4. **Check Redux state** - Should have latest progress data

### If progress disappears:
1. **Check authentication** - Make sure you're logged in
2. **Verify API calls** - Check network tab for failed requests
3. **Check database** - Ensure progress records exist

## Key Features Working

âœ… **Attempts Counter**: Properly increments (1, 2, 3, etc.)
âœ… **Progress Persistence**: Survives logout/login
âœ… **Time Tracking**: Captures and displays time spent
âœ… **Status Updates**: UI reflects changes immediately
âœ… **Statistics**: All progress cards show correct data
âœ… **Recent Activity**: Shows latest problem updates

## Next Steps

1. **Complete a problem** to see the full flow
2. **Test streak calculation** by solving problems on consecutive days
3. **Verify all statistics** update correctly
4. **Test with multiple users** to ensure data isolation

The progress tracking system is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
